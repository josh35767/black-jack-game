# black-jack-game
Simple Black Jack game made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery
Includes a startup menu, an option to add your name, and a instructions system.
The game is mobile friendly, and is fairly responsive. 
Basic features include "hit", which gives you a single card.
"Stand", which ends your turn and
"Double Down", which gives you a single card and immediately ends your turn.

Every player is given $50 of chips to begin with and each round a player must bet 5 chips, if their hand is greater than the dealer's, or the dealer busts by the end of the round, the player's bet is doubled. However if the player's hand value is greater than 21, they automatically "bust", meaning, they loses the round. If a player chooses to double down, they increase their bet to $10, but potentially gains an extra $10 with the win.

The player will win the game if they has 100 or more chips, however, if they drop to 0, the game is over.
